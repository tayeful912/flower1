            <p>Flower is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground grain and the reproductive

                of the Italian goddess of flowers, Flora. The early word for flower in English was blossom,[2] though it
                now refers to flowers only of fruit trees</p>

                <h1>Function</h1>

                <p>The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction of the individual and the species. All
                    flowering
                    plants are heterosporous, that is, every individual plant produces two types of spores. Microspores
                    are
                </p>

                <h1>Pollination</h1>
                <p>The primary purpose of the flower is reproduction.[22] Since the flowers are the reproductive organs
                    of
                    the plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules â€” contained
                    in
                    the ovary.

                <h1>Biotic pollination</h1>
                <p>Flowers that use biotic vectors attract and use insects, bats, birds, or other animals to transfer
                    pollen
                    from one flower to the next. Often they are specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the
                    stamens

                <h1>Attraction methods</h1>

                <p>Plants cannot move from one location to another, thus many flowers have evolved to attract animals to
                    transfer pollen between individuals in dispersed populations. Most commonly, flowers are
                    insect-pollinated, known as entomophilous
                    genus
